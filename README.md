List of My projects
Inspired by Andrej Karpathy, Justin Johnson, Cs231n, Elon Musk's tweet about PyTorch :)
Most projects are implented on low level using Pytorch tensors only as a gpu accelerating data type, only few of them (most complicated ones) utilize some pytorch high level API functions 

#### Long-Short-Term-Memory
Many people use a variant on the vanilla RNN called Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs because Vanilla RNNs can be tough to train on long sequences due to vanishing and exploding gradients caused by repeated matrix multiplication. LSTMs solve this problem by replacing the simple update rule of the vanilla RNN with a gating mechanism as follows.

#### Attention
Attention is the idea of freeing the encoder-decoder architecture from the fixed-length internal representation.
This is achieved by keeping the intermediate outputs from the encoder LSTM from each step of the input sequence and training the model to learn to pay selective attention to these inputs and relate them to items in the output sequence.

### [Neural Networks Visualization](https://github.com/shushukurov/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/NetworkVisualization)

#### Saliency Maps

A saliency map tells the degree to which each pixel in the image affects the classification score for that image.

#### Adversarial Attacks

Use of image gradients to generate "adversarial attacks". Given an image and a target class, It is possible to perform gradient ascent over the image to maximize the target class, stopping when the network classifies the image as the target class.

#### Class visualization

By starting with a random noise image and performing gradient ascent on a target class, It is possible to generate an image that the network will recognize as the target class.
